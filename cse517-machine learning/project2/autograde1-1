This is your grade report from the Autograder ran on 22-Feb-2018 16:57:29. 
For this project we ran 1 evaluation(s) on your committed code.

	On the nb_evaluation you scored 0 points with our tests.
	Unfortunately, you failed 7 test(s) on this evaluation:
		Failed Test 1 naivebayesPY: Probabilities of P(Y) do not sum to 1.Output argument "pos" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "naivebayesPY".
		Failed Test 2 naivebayesPXY: The calculation of P(Y) seems incorrect.Output argument "pos" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "naivebayesPY".
		Failed Test 3: The calculation of P(X|Y) seems incorrect.Output argument "posprob" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "naivebayesPXY".
		Failed Test 4~8: naivebayesPXY failedOutput argument "posprob" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "naivebayesPXY".
		Failed Test 9: The calculation of log P(Y=1|X)/P(Y=-1|X) seems incorrect.Output argument "logratio" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "naivebayes".
		Failed Test 10: Naive Bayes seems incorrect.Output argument "w" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "naivebayesCL".
		Failed Test 11: Naive Bayes Training accuracy <= 0.6 -- this seems like a bad classifier.Output argument "w" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "naivebayesCL".

This is your grade report from the Autograder ran on 03-Feb-2018 20:17:15. 
For this project we ran 1 evaluation(s) on your committed code.

	On the srm_evaluation you scored 0 points with our tests.
	Unfortunately, you failed 12 test(s) on this evaluation:
		Test 1: Logistic function does not pass checkgrad.Output argument "loss" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "logistic".
		Test 2: Logistic function does not pass sanity check #1.Output argument "loss" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "logistic".
		Test 3: Logistic function does not pass sanity check #2.Output argument "loss" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "logistic".
		Test 4: Ridge function does not pass checkgrad.Output argument "loss" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "ridge".
		Test 5: Hinge function does not pass checkgrad.Output argument "loss" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "hinge".
		Test 6: Gradient descent seems wrong - gradient is not zero at minimum!Output argument "w" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "grdescent".
		Test 7: Hinge gradient does not match solution.Output argument "loss" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "hinge".
		Test 8: Hinge function does not match solution.Output argument "loss" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "hinge".
		Test 9: Logistc gradient does not match solution.Output argument "loss" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "logistic".
		Test 10: Logistic function does not match solution.Output argument "loss" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "logistic".
		Test 11: Ridge gradient does not match solution.Output argument "loss" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "ridge".
		Test 12: Ridge function does not match solution.Output argument "loss" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "ridge".
